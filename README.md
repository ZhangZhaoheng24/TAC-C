# TAC-C
Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) direct precise gene expression for development and environmental response, yet their spatial organization in crops is largely unknown. We introduce Transposase-Accessible Chromosome Conformation Capture (TAC-C), a method integrating ATAC-seq and Hi-C to capture fine-scale chromatin interactions in four major crops: rice, sorghum, maize, and wheat. TAC-C reveals a strong association between chromatin interaction frequency and gene expression, particularly emphasizing the conserved role of chromatin interaction hub anchors and hub genes across crop species.
